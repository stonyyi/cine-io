<h2>cine.io Privacy Policy</h2>
<h3>Effective as of February 1, 2014</h3>
<p>At cine.io, a website operated by BML Ventures, LLC (“Cine.io”), we are committed to respecting people’s privacy online. We are also committed to providing you with the very best experience we can on our website. In order to do so, we may gather certain personal information about you. Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you make full use of our website. By using cine.io, you consent to the collection and use of your information by Cine.io as described in this Policy, and you signify your agreement to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>What information does Cine.io collect?</strong></p>
<p>When you visit cine.io, we collect some basic information that does not identify individual users. This includes which pages are visited and any feedback from our visitors. We then aggregate this information with other pieces of information to improve our site and make your experience on the site as valuable and efficient as possible.</p>
<p>When you create a Cine.io account, we may collect personal information such as name, age, address, phone and email in order to set up your account.  </p>
<p>In addition to the information we collect upon your initial registration with cine.io, we may ask you for personal information at other times, including, but not limited to, when you enter promotions or contests, and when you respond to a survey.</p>
<p>We may also collect and accumulate anonymous data which will help us understand and analyze the Internet experience of its website users. For instance, we may accumulate visitor data relating to referring domain names, the type of browsers used, operating system software, screen resolutions, color capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search engine keywords and JavaScript enablement.</p>
<p>We also collect IP addresses for system administration and reporting. While an IP address does not identify an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation of the ISP, be used to locate and identify an individual. Your IP address can, however, reveal what geographic area you are connecting from, or which ISP you are using. Finally, other websites you visit have IP addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages.</p>
<p>Upon cancelling your account, you have the right to request deletion of your account information, subject to our need to keep appropriate archives for our business operations.</p>
<p><strong>What do we do with the information we collect?</strong></p>
<p>It is used to set up and maintain your cine.io account.  If you provide us with your mobile phone information, we may use such information to communicate with you regarding cine.io by SMS, MMS, text message or other electronic means to a mobile device.</p>
<p>Your personal information will never be sold to any other website owner or merchant. We hate junk mail as much as you. This is why we will only send you email about items that we feel you should know about. This includes special promotional items that Cine.io endorses, membership changes, terms and conditions changes, holiday cards, and the latest happenings on cine.io.  When we send you emails that include a link to the cine.io, that link may contain an alphanumeric identifier that allows us to identify the person to whom we sent the message so that we can personalize our content for that individual.</p>
<p><strong>Email Opt-out</strong></p>
<p>Users who no longer wish to receive our email updates or other notifications may opt-out of receiving these communications by following the instructions contained in the applicable email or by logging-in and changing their account settings.</p>
<p><strong>Credit Card Processing</strong></p>
<p>Credit card transactions are handled by a third-party processor that receives credit card numbers and other personally identifying information only to verify credit card accounts and process transactions.</p>
<p>Credit card security is an important aspect of the online experience. In order to keep your credit card information safe, it is encrypted using a secure server, so that your credit card and billing information cannot be read as it travels through our payment system.</p>
<p><strong>With whom do we share your information and for what purpose?</strong></p>
<p>Cine.io does not sell, rent, or trade any personally identifying information with others. However, Cine.io may provide your personal information (but not your credit card information) to one or more of our business partners who co-sponsor a service, promotion and/or contest. If we intend to share such information, you will be notified prior to the collection of that information. If you do not want your information to be shared, you will be able to choose not to allow the transfer by not using or signing up for that particular service, promotion or contest.</p>
<p>We may also share aggregate user information in a non-personally identifiable manner with advertisers and other third parties in order to present to users more targeted advertising, products and services.</p>
<p>We may contract with third parties to conduct research and marketing on our behalf.  Such third parties will be fully bound by an obligation of confidentiality and may not use any personally-identifiable information provided by us other than as expressly instructed by us and in strict compliance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>What information do parties other than Cine.io collect?</strong></p>
<p>Some entities that have links on our site may collect personally identifying information about you when you access or utilize those links.  Cine.io does not control the collection or use of such information, and the practices of those advertisers and websites are not covered by this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>It is important to note that those entities may not follow the same privacy policies as Cine.io. For instance, if you click on an advertisement on cine.io, you may be taken away from cine.io to an entirely different site.  These links can also be from advertisers, content providers and/or partners who may use Cine.io’s logo and/or style as a result of a co-branding agreement yet they may still not follow the same privacy policies as Cine.io.</p>
<p><strong>What are “cookies” and “web beacons” and how do we use them?</strong></p>
<p>Our site may use “cookies” and “web beacons” to speed navigation, keep track of items, and provide you with custom-tailored services.  A “web beacon” is an embedded GIF file that specifically helps us track whether you have viewed a specific piece of content. We also use “cookies” to remember information you gave us so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit the site. By showing us how and when visitors use the site, “cookies” and “web beacons” help us see which site areas and content are popular and which are not. Some advertisers or websites that have links on our site may also use their own “cookies.”</p>
<p>Most browsers are initially set to accept “cookies.” If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse “cookies.” You will not be able to use our service if you turn off the “cookies” option.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>Cine.io member accounts are secured by member-created passwords.  In addition, we use reasonable measures to protect member information that is stored within our database, and we restrict access to member information to those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our customer service personnel and technical staff.</p>
<p>We use reasonable measures, including encryption technology, to keep your account information safe. However, please note that we cannot guarantee the security of member account information.  Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of our member information at any time.</p>
<p><strong>COPPA compliance</strong></p>
<p>We have designed this privacy policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). We will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13. If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because we do not collect such information, we have no such information to use or to disclose to third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Business transitions</strong></p>
<p>In the event Cine.io goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.</p>
<p>California User Consumer Rights</p>
<p>In accordance with California Civil Code Sec. 1789.3, California resident users are entitled to know that they may file grievances and complaints with California Department of Consumer Affairs, 400 R Street, STE1080, Sacramento, CA 95814; or by phone at 916-445-1254 or 800-952-5210; or by email to dca@dca.ca.gov.
